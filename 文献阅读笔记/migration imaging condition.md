Jones, I. (2014). Tutorial: migration imaging conditions. first break, 32(12), 45-55.
+ The final stage of the migration process is that which forms the image, via what is known as an imaging condition.
+ Wherever the source and receiver wavefields are in the same place at the same time, there must be a reflector. This observation forms the basis of an imaging condition.
+ The travel time computation is preceded with a slop field determination (typically using a slant stack analysis of shot, receiver, or offset gathers), which facilitates selection of only those travel paths that will meaningfull contribute to the image.
+ Surface offset gathers can be later converted to angle gathers, or in beam schemes and Kirchhoff variants such as common reflection angle migration (Koren et al.,2007) angle gathers can be formed directly.
+ For a wavefield extrapolation migration we can be build an image by multiplying the source and receiver wavefields together at each propagation time step, and where we have a high amplitude contribution resulting from this product, there must have been a reflector in the subsurface.
+ This summation of wavefield products is referred to as the correlation imaging condition in shot migration: the image is being formed by what is essentially a correction of downgoing and upcoming wavefield(e.g.Bancroft,1997).
